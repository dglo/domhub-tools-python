hubmoni.py is a DOMHub monitoring tool that sends DOR driver monitoring
quantities to IceCube Live as well as user alerts for DOM / DOR problems.  

Can be installed on a set of DOMHub from pdaq@sp[t]s-access with

    $ fab pack deploy

This will also install a cron job on the hub that will start the script.

Configuration files can be updated without redeploying the entire package,
with

    $ fab config restart

--

For standalone installation on, for example, a lab DOMHub, the "fab"
command is not available.  Instead, on the hub itself as the testdaq user,
check out this repository and execute

    $ python setup.py install --user

from the top level directory.  This doesn't start hubmoni itself but does
install the supporting Python libraries and scripts.
