hubmoni.py is a DOMHub monitoring tool that sends DOR driver monitoring
quantities to IceCube Live as well as user alerts for DOM / DOR problems.  

Can be installed on a set of DOMHub from sp[t]s-access with

    $ fab pack deploy

This will also install a cron job on the hub that will start the script.

TODO:

* Move out of sandbox
* Add "quickstatus" functionality
* Add hubmoni easy disable / enable?
